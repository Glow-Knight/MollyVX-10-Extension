This patch does not function by itself, but requires the original MollyVX shader pack and provides a means to extend its functionality.
Shader packs with this patch will maintain the license terms of the original MollyVX shader pack.
In other words, users can use the patched shaders for personal use as private modifications, but they cannot redistribute them without the permission of the original MollyVX shader pack author.

This mod includes a GNU patch under the GPL, but the PowerShell script provided as a patch tool only automates the execution of patch commands, and is not subject to any software licenses, including the GPL.
